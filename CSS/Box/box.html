        Create a page containing two paragraphs.
        The first paragraph should have a yellow background
        The second paragraph should have a red background
        Add a lot of text to both of them

    Fixed size
        The first paragraph has width of 400px and height of 500px
        The second should have 600px width and 300px height
        Paragraph text should not overflow the box

    Dynamic size
        Max width of the first paragraph should be 300px
        Max height of the second one should be 200px
        The first paragraph text should be cut if it's bigger than the box
        The second paragraph text can overflow the paragraph (text can be bigger than the paragraph box)

    Borders
        Create three paragraphs on the page
        All of them should have a yellow background
        Each paragraph should have a 5px thick border
        The first and the last paragraphs should have red dashed borders
        The middle one should have green solid borders

    Padding
        Use the previous example or create three new paragraphs with bg color
        Set padding for each paragraph
        The first and the third should have a 50px padding around all sides
        The middle one should have a 50px top padding only


    Margins
        Use the previous example and add margins to each element
        The first should be 300px wide and should have 50px margins around all sides
        The second should be 400px wide and it should be horizontally centered on the screen
        The third one should be 200px wide and should have a 100px wide left margin

    Inline/Block Elements
        Transform the structure from the previous exercise
        Each paragraph should have the right margin set to 20px and no padding (0)
        Elements should all be in one row

    Hide/Show | Box Shadows | Rounded Corners

    Hide/Show 
        Hide the middle paragraph from the previous example
        The third paragraph should be hidden


    Box Shadow

        Set width of the title to 960px
        Position the heading box to the center of the page
        The text in the heading should be centered

        <p class="firstParagraph">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
